  ðŸ“š Datasets Provided

Two datasets were shared for analysis:

- customer_orders.csv
  - `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order
  - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
  - `order_date`: Date when the order was placed
  - `order_amount`: Amount of the order
  - `shipping_address`: Customerâ€™s shipping address
  - `order_status`: Current status of the order (pending, shipped, delivered)

- payments.csv
  - `payment_id`: Unique identifier for each payment
  - `order_id`: Linked order ID for payment
  - `payment_date`: Date when payment was made
  - `payment_amount`: Amount paid
  - `payment_method`: Payment method used (e.g., PayPal, Credit Card)
  - `payment_status`: Status of payment (completed, failed)

 ðŸ›  Technologies and Tools Used

- Python 3.8
- SQLite3 (In-memory database for running SQL queries)
- Pandas (for data manipulation and processing)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for cohort analysis visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive coding and visualization)
- VSCode / GitHub (for project management and version control)

 ðŸ“ˆ SQL Query Highlights

- Analyzed order status distribution using `GROUP BY`.
- Calculated total and monthly sales using date functions.
- Identified repeat customers using window functions (`RANK()`).
- Analyzed payment success/failure patterns.
- Built an enriched dataset joining orders with payment information.

_All SQL queries are included inside Python scripts using SQLite._
