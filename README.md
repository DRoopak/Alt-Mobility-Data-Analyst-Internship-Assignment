# Alt-Mobility-Data-Analyst-Internship-Assignment
"Analyzed customer orders and payments to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and payment success rates. Built SQL-driven insights and visualized customer retention using cohort analysis to recommend data-backed strategies for Alt Mobility."


PROBLEM SPACE:
You are provided with two datasets:

payments.csv → Payment data

customer_orders.csv → Order data

You need to use SQL to perform these tasks:

1. Order and Sales Analysis
Analyze order status (e.g., completed, pending, canceled) and sales trends.

Identify key metrics like:

Fulfillment rates.

Revenue trends over time.

2. Customer Analysis
Explore customer behaviors such as:

Repeat ordering.

Segmentation (possibly by geography, vehicle type, or usage).

Trends over a timeline (monthly, quarterly).

3. Payment Status Analysis
Investigate payment success/failure rates.

Identify issues or patterns (e.g., failures on certain days or for certain payment methods).

4. Order Details Report
Create a detailed report linking:

Order info + Payment details.

Key operational metrics.

VISUALIZATION TASK:
5. Customer Retention Analysis
Visualize how many customers from each cohort (e.g., customers who signed up in January) made repeat purchases in later months.

Use a BI visualization tool (such as Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, etc.).

Explain clearly how the visualization shows customer retention trends (e.g., retention matrix, cohort analysis graph).
